A to-do list is a simple yet powerful tool for organizing tasks and managing time effectively. It typically consists of a list of items or activities that need to be completed, along with deadlines or priorities assigned to each item. To-do lists help individuals stay focused, prioritize tasks, and track progress, ultimately leading to increased productivity and reduced stress.
